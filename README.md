# Neural Machine Translation Between English and Turkish

This repo contains a very early version of a pair of NMT models between English and Turkish (in both directions). One can download the pre-trained models from the `releases` section and use the Jupyter notebook in the root directory as a reference.

The model is trained on cloud TPU's using Google's tensor2tensor library.
